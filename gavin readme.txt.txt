Hi Gavin,

Regarding user accounts:
- User 1 has fully populated data in favourites & has a recipe created too.
- User 2 has favourites data.
- User 3 is empty.
We created different user accounts so it was obvious that the data for each user stayed with that user.

Some things to note:
- please use Wifi - our app does download quite a few images!
- the images for the categories take awhile to load
- takes time to generate quiz questions. It might feel like it's not loading but it is, in the background!
- if you click between nav bar icons too quickly the app might crash. Please let each page load before taking the next action!

Hope you enjoy looking through our app and maybe learn something new about drinks :)
